  "problem": "Develop a feature-rich asynchronous Python Discord bot for YouTube audio/video playback with dual command interfaces (prefix/slash) and an interactive player UI featuring a live progress bar.",
  "thinking_type": "systems",
  "context": "The bot needs robust queue management, permissions, effects, search, screensharing, vote-skip, idle disconnect, and persistent elements like saved queues and prefixes. Key challenges include the live progress bar (rate limits), state synchronization between commands and UI, and managing external dependencies like yt-dlp and ffmpeg. Modularity via Cogs is highly recommended.",
