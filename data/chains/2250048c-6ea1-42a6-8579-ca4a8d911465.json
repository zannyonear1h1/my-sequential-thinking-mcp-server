      "reasoning": "This is the central functionality. Focus on connecting to voice, using yt-dlp to fetch audio streams, basic queueing (add/play), and essential commands (play, stop, skip, basic queue view). Implement PlayerManager and GuildPlayer.",

Ensure UI actions correctly interact with the GuildPlayer state.",

Add advanced queue management (save/load, import/export, manipulation), search, seeking, effects, volume control, looping, permissions/DJ mode, vote-skip, idle disconnect, video screensharing, Stage Channel support, and enhance the interactive UI with corresponding controls (buttons, selects, modals).",
