It needs two modes: controlling a dedicated Puppeteer instance (PNM) and controlling the user's Chrome via an extension (URBM). Key requirements include secure AI key handling, passing browser context (screenshots, DOM, URL, tabs) to the AI, a user intervention mechanism (pause/resume), robust logging, and comprehensive documentation/tutorial.",
