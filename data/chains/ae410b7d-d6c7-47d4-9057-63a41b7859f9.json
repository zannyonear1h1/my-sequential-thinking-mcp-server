      "evidence": "For a VS Code clone with Merlin API integration and MCP server support, the following stack is recommended: 1) React as the UI library (confirmed by user) 2) TypeScript for type safety (VS Code itself is built with TypeScript) 3) Electron for desktop capabilities if needed 4) Monaco Editor for code editing (the same editor used by VS Code) 5) xterm.js for terminal emulation 6) WebSockets for real-time communication 7) Redux or Context API for state management 8) React-Split for resizable panels 9) Styled-components or CSS modules for styling 10) Axios for API requests to Merlin 11) Node.js for backend functionality",
