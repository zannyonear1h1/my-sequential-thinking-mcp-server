  "context": "Goal: Design and implement a system with a Chrome Extension and an MCP Server for browser automation controlled by an AI assistant (Cline) via MCP tools.\n\nContext:\n- User: AI assistant (Cline).\n- Mechanism: Cline -> use_mcp_tool -> MCP Server -> Chrome Extension -> Browser.\n- Environment: Node.js (TypeScript) MCP Server, HTML/CSS/JS Chrome Extension.\n- Communication: Needs definition (Native Messaging or WebSockets).\n\nPhase 1: Resource Preparation & Planning\n1. Define Communication Protocol (JSON messages: command, response, event, error).\n2. Outline Extension Architecture (background, content scripts, manifest permissions).\n3. Outline MCP Server Architecture (framework, connection management, tool handling, state).\n4. Security Considerations (authorization, script execution risks).\n5. Installation/Setup Plan (extension loading, server config/run).\n\nPhase 2: MCP Server Design & Implementation\n1. Server Setup (Node.js/TS project, dependencies).\n2. MCP Tool Definition (ListToolsRequestSchema handler, comprehensive tool list: Session Mgmt, Navigation, Element Interaction, Waiting, Scraping, Page/Browser Actions, Tab/Window Mgmt, Advanced).\n3. Implement CallToolRequestSchema Handler (parse/validate args, translate to extension command, send, wait for response, translate back, error handling).\n\nPhase 3: Chrome Extension Implementation\n1. Manifest (v3, permissions, background, content scripts, nativeMessaging).\n2. Background Script (connect to server, listen for commands, use Chrome APIs, communicate with content scripts, send responses).\n3. Content Scripts (listen to background, perform DOM actions, send results back).\n\nFinal Steps:\n1. Testing.\n2. Documentation.\n3. Packaging.",
