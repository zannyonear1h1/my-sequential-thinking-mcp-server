  "problem": "Develop a feature-rich asynchronous Discord music bot with Python (discord.py v2+), supporting multiple audio sources (YouTube, SoundCloud via yt-dlp), video screensharing, dual control interfaces (prefix/slash commands, interactive UI), advanced queue management, permissions (DJ mode), audio effects, vote-to-skip, Stage Channel support, and persistence.",
  "thinking_type": "systems",
  "context": "The goal is a robust, well-commented, modular (Cog-based) bot adhering to specific technical requirements and user experience goals outlined in the initial request. Requires integration with external tools like yt-dlp and ffmpeg. Emphasis on stable audio and consistent state management between control interfaces.",

      "reasoning": "Establish a clear, modular structure using Discord.py Cogs for maintainability and scalability. Identify key components needed to fulfill the requirements.",
      "evidence": "The project requires numerous distinct functionalities (playback, UI, queue management, permissions, configuration, error handling) which map well to separate Cogs. Requirements specify modularity.",
