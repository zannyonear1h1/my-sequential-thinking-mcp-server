  "problem": "Develop a feature-rich asynchronous Discord music bot focused on YouTube playback with dual command interfaces (prefix/slash) and an interactive player UI including a live progress bar.",
  "thinking_type": "systems",
  "context": "The bot needs features like playlist support, search, permissions (DJ mode), advanced queue management, audio effects, quality selection, vote-to-skip, Stage Channel support, and video screensharing. Key challenge is the live-updating progress bar without hitting rate limits. Project requires Python, discord.py, yt-dlp, ffmpeg.",
