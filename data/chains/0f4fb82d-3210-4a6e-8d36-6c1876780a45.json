  "problem": "Generate a complete, well-commented, and robust asynchronous Python project for a Discord music bot with features including multi-source playback (YouTube, SoundCloud), video screensharing, dual control interfaces (prefix/slash commands, interactive UI), advanced queue management, permissions (DJ mode), vote-to-skip, Stage Channel support, and audio effects.",
  "thinking_type": "systems",
  "context": "The bot needs to be built using discord.py (supporting UI, Slash Commands, Stages), asyncio, yt-dlp, and potentially ffmpeg-python. It requires configuration files (token, cookies) and persistence for queues and settings. The output should include the Python code (preferably Cog-based), requirements.txt, and setup instructions. Key challenges include state synchronization between different control methods and stable audio/video handling.",
