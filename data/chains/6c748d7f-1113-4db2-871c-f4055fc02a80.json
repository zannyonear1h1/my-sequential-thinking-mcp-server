  "thinking_type": "systems",
  "context": "The server, named 'Zanny's Browser Automation Hybrid MCP Server V1.0', should use the Gemini 2.0 Flash model via a provided API key. It needs to support both Puppeteer (PNM) and user's live browser (URBM) automation modes, handle user interventions, provide robust logging, and include comprehensive documentation (README.md, TUTORIAL.html). The project will be built from scratch in 'C:\\Users\\Shadow\\Cline Data\\MCPs 1\\Hybrid Browsing Automator MCP Server\\V1.0'. Key features include passing screenshots and relevant browser state to the AI for accurate navigation and supporting all Puppeteer actions.",

      "reasoning": "Develop the central components of the MCP server required for AI-driven Puppeteer automation. This includes setting up the server basics, integrating the Gemini AI for decision-making, capturing browser state via Puppeteer, and executing the AI's commands using a dedicated PNM controller. This establishes the primary automation capability.",
      "evidence": "This step directly addresses requirements 1, 2, 3, 4 (partially - state capture), 6 (initial logging), and 9 (PNM). It builds upon Step 1 by adding the core server logic and AI integration needed for the first automation mode.",
