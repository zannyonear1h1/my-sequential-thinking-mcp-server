  "thinking_type": "systems",

It requires a persistent interactive player message with a live progress bar, dual command interfaces (prefix/slash), advanced queue features (save/load/import/export), permissions (DJ mode), audio effects, seeking, vote-skip, idle disconnect, and Stage Channel support. Uses discord.py, yt-dlp, ffmpeg.",
