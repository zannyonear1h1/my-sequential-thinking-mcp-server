      "reasoning": "Breaking the system down into major components is the first step in understanding the overall architecture and complexity. This provides a foundational structure for further analysis and design. Components likely include: Core Server Loop, Network Layer (Protocol Handling), World Management (Loading, Saving, Simulation), Entity Management, Spigot API Implementation Layer, Plugin System/Loader, Command System, Permissions System, Configuration Management, and Web Interface Backend/Frontend.",

For example: Network Layer receives player input -> passes to Command System or Core Loop; Core Loop updates World/Entities -> sends updates via Network Layer; Plugin System hooks into Core Loop, API Layer, Command System, etc.; Web Interface interacts with Config, Permissions, and potentially Core Loop via an internal API.",
