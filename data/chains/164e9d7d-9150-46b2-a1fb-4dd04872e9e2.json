  "problem": "Analyze Vencord source code to understand how it enables Discord experiments (specifically for reverting UI changes), then create a PowerShell script to close Discord, reopen it with the old UI using that mechanism, create a desktop shortcut, and show a warning dialog.",
  "thinking_type": "systems",
  "context": "The user wants to revert Discord's UI to a pre-March 2025 state, likely using Vencord's experiment manipulation features. The script should automate closing Discord, reopening it in the desired state, and provide user feedback/convenience (shortcut, warning). Vencord source code is available in 'Reference 1'.",
