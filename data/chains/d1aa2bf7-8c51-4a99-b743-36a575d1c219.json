  "problem": "Design and plan the implementation of a Puppeteer-based MCP server named 'puppeteer-browser' for robust, observable browser automation, including advanced NLP control and resilience.",
  "thinking_type": "systems",
  "context": "Detailed requirements provided by the user:\n\n**1. Overall Goal:**\nCreate an MCP server named `puppeteer-browser` that enables Roo Cline & Cline to perform browser automation tasks using Puppeteer. The server should control *non-headless* Chrome browser instances, allowing the user to observe the automation in real-time. The server must aim for **guaranteed operation across all target websites**, employing advanced techniques to handle variations and anti-automation measures.\nBe sure to use the AI model that is current set on Roo Code, and before each step is performed, anaylze the image using the model from Roo Code's configuration, then use that to find issues with the browser or page, or if there is a captcha, a block, a rate limit, any issue can be found and can be resolved accordingly.\n\n**2. Core Functionality (Puppeteer Actions):**\nThe server must provide tools corresponding to common Puppeteer actions, including but not limited to:\n*   `goto(url)`\n*   `click(selector)`\n*   `type(selector, text, [options])`\n*   `select(selector, value)`\n*   `waitForSelector(selector, [options])`\n*   `evaluate(js_function, ...args)`\n*   `extractText(selector)`\n*   `extractAttribute(selector, attributeName)`\n*   `screenshot([options])`\n*   `scroll(x, y)`\n*   `hover(selector)`\nExtensible design for future actions.\n\n**3. Concurrency and State Management:**\n*   **Multiple Sessions:** Support managing multiple concurrent browser sessions independently.\n*   **Complex State Management:** Robust mechanisms for managing complex state (logins, cookies, storage, variables) across requests within a session.\n\n**4. Invocation / Triggering:**\n*   **Direct Commands:** Clear prefix (e.g., `browser(session_id): action`).\n*   **Advanced Natural Language Intent:** AI-driven interpretation for ambiguous/complex multi-step tasks.\n\n**5. Configurable Parameters:**\n*   `default_delay_ms`\n*   `navigation_timeout_ms`\n*   `user_agent_string`\n*   `viewport_width`, `viewport_height`\n*   `screenshot_on_error` (boolean)\n*   `data_extraction_format` (json, csv, text_list)\nAllow overrides.\n\n**6. Error Handling & Resilience:**\n*   Advanced error handling (retries, timeouts).\n*   Strategies for anti-bot/CAPTCHAs.\n*   Extensive logging.\n*   **Advanced Resilience & Self-Correction:** Intelligent retries, dynamic selector adaptation, AI-driven problem solving (diagnose, formulate alternatives, minimize clarification requests).\n\n**7. Data Handling:**\n*   Clear structure for single/multiple results (using `data_extraction_format`).\n*   Likely JSON output.",
