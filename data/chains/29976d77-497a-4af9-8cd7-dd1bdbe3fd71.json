      "reasoning": "Establish the project layout (directories, main file) and decide how configuration (token, prefix, roles, etc.) will be loaded and accessed. This is foundational for all subsequent development.",

      "description": "Implement Core Audio Playback Cog (Basic Join/Leave/Play/Stop)",
      "reasoning": "With the core structure in place, the next step is to implement the fundamental audio playback capabilities: connecting to voice channels, disconnecting, fetching a stream URL using yt-dlp, starting playback with FFmpegPCMAudio, and stopping playback. This forms the basis for all other music features.",
      "evidence": "Directly addresses core requirements from `projectbrief.md`. Builds upon the Cog structure defined in `systemPatterns.md` and uses technologies from `techContext.md` (discord.py voice, yt-dlp, ffmpeg).",

      "description": "Implement Queue Management (Data Structure, Add, Skip, View)",
      "reasoning": "The core playback works for single tracks. The next essential feature is a queue to manage multiple tracks. This involves defining the queue data structure, modifying 'play' to add tracks, implementing the logic to automatically play the next track, and adding basic commands like 'skip' and 'queue' (view).",
      "evidence": "Core requirement from `projectbrief.md`. Builds upon the `PlaybackCog`. Requires modifying the `after` callback logic and introducing per-guild state management as planned in `systemPatterns.md`.",

      "reasoning": "With playback and queue logic functional via commands, the next step is to create the interactive player message using discord.ui.View. This involves defining the View class with buttons (Play/Pause, Skip, Stop), creating/updating the embed, and linking button interactions back to the playback/queue logic.",
